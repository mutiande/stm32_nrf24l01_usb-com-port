STM32F103C8T6 is my microcontroller for this project.
It will be connected to a NRF24L01 radio device via SPI.
When the µController is connected to a PC it presents itself as a Virtual COM-Port.

An application for controlling the µController from Linux is available here <Github repo not created yet>
